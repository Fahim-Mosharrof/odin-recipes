    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fish and chips is a classic British dish consisting of battered and deep-fried fish fillets served with crispy, golden chips (fries). Often accompanied by mushy peas, tartar sauce, and a splash of vinegar, it's a beloved comfort food.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>White fish fillets (such as cod or haddock)</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Baking Powder</li>
        <li>Frying Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare Batter:</b> Mix all-purpose flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt with cold water to make a smooth batter. Let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Cut Potatoes:</b> Peel and cut potatoes into thick chips, then soak them in cold water for 30 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
        <li><b>Heat Oil:</b> Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li><b>Fry Chips:</b> Drain and dry the potatoes, then fry them in batches until golden and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li><b>Fry Fish:</b> Dip fish fillets into the batter, letting excess drip off, then carefully lower them into the hot oil. Fry until the fish is golden and cooked through.</li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b> Season the fish and chips with salt, and serve hot with tartar sauce, vinegar, and optional sides like mushy peas.</li>
    </ol>
